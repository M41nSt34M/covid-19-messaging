Hi All,

We are experts working in infectious disease and public health, and we wanted to share some information about COVID-19 (the disease caused by the new coronavirus). We know a lot of information is going around, and we want to summarize the key information as of now (2020/03/01)

Please feel free to pass along to others, keeping in mind that the situation is changing as we learn more about the disease.


# Practical Advice for Keeping Yourself and Your Family Safe:
## Taking care of your family

We understand COVID-19 causes relatively mild illness unless you are older or already have other diseases. This is the time to think about what you might need to do to protect those members of your family, friends, and community, such as:
* taking time off to care for them
* bringing them groceries and helping them refill their medications
* washing your hands immediately after getting inside
* helping them stay in contact with friends and family by helping them set up video chat or other electronic communication
* having non-grandparent childcare ready if schools have to close down since elderly are at highest risk. The risk to the elderly is highest, so if you can, help them take care of children so grandparents don’t have unnecessary exposures
* staying away from large events or social gatherings IF there is evidence of spread in your community
* having a plan of how to stay away if you feel sick while still providing the care they might need, like talking to your friends or extended relatives nearby how you might support one another if needed.


## Hygiene
Research has shown that at least half are actually through touching the disease and carrying it onto your face. That's why washing is important!

* Wash your hands more often and for at least 20 seconds each time. Carry some hand sanitizer for when a sink isn't readily available. 
  * If it helps, 20 seconds is about how long these are: 
    * The first two lines of the karaoke staple Teresa Teng song “The Moon Represents My Heart”
    * The chorus to Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts”
    * Half of the chorus to Utada Hikaru’s “First Love”
    * Slightly less than the chorus to “Let it go” 
    * About the length of that portion of the kimi no wa song that starts with the bit about ‘time flyers’ 
* Washing your hands is ALWAYS better than using hand sanitizer. Practice those routines so they become a habit. Even if you think you know how to, check out the CDC's guide to proper handwashing: https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html 
* Clean your electronics (e.g. phone, laptop) with soap and water, or cleaning wipes.
* Practice touching your faces less. Pay attention to how often you touch your face - it’s a lot more than you think!
* Don’t be hesitant about refusing to shake hands in certain settings.
* Start building habits like pushing elevator buttons with a knuckle or pushing open doors with your forearm.

## Masks
* If you’re sick, use a mask!
* If you’re not sick, a mask can actually give inexperienced users a false sense of security. Many people touch their faces more often while wearing a mask, increasing their chances to infect themselves.
* Keep a few masks on hand for you and your family, but don’t go overboard. After all, we don’t have infinite masks, and we should save them for sick people and healthcare workers. Healthcare workers need them the most to protect themselves.

## Other Types of Vaccination
* Try to get elderly people vaccinated with the pneumococcal disease vaccine (PPSV-23 or PCV-13). Viral pneumonia often leads to bacterial pneumonia; this vaccine offers a layer of protection for them. Additionally, it will help keep them out of hospitals.
* It’s still flu season! If you haven’t yet, everyone should get the flu shot to decrease chances of contracting other respiratory disease.

## Preparing at Home
If COVID-19 begins to spread widely in your area, it may be more difficult to get food, medicine, and other items if you need to stay home, avoid crowds, and so on. We are NOT talking about extreme shortages, just inconveniences, but if you need steady access to medication or other resources:
* Try to get a few extra weeks/months worth of prescription medications, as well as other routine over-the-counter meds and related supplies you typically use
  * This might include things such as painkillers (acetaminophen, naproxen, ibuprofen) and antihistamines. Think about what you want in a first aid kit.
* Also consider SLOWLY stocking up on some extra non-perishable foods like frozen items, canned goods, and so on. There is no need to be panic-buying,but you want to give yourself a bit of reserve if staying home for a week or two is recommended during a wave of transmission.
* Make a plan for what you will do if schools or childcare centers are closed - if you don't have kids think about how you might be able to help your friends or neighbors in those situations.
* Ask your workplace / employer if they have any particular plans in place if there are a lot of cases in your area for a period of time - encourage them to have a plan in place. One example: are staff being cross-trained to help cover for one another in the event of illness? Or are there options to work from home for everyone?
* If you are a CEO, community leader, or otherwise responsible for organized gatherings, consider cancelling events if we reach a point where there are high levels of transmission in your area. Plan for that in advance. In the meantime, use your platform to help inform people about steps they should be taking now.

## Stay Informed
There is a lot of disinformation out there. A lot of people are trying to take advantage of your fear. Stay informed through health department websites and reputable news outlets and help the people in your life to do the same.

In the US, State and Local Health departments take the lead in these situations, with CDC providing additional resources where needed and taking the lead on setting the national agenda and guidelines. Paying attention to your State and Local health departments is the best way to stay informed of what is happening in your particular area.

Singapore has been extremely vigilant about its outbreak control so far. Their website has some great resources for general advice: (https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/resources)[https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/resources]
However, knowing what’s going on locally is the most important to keep an eye on!

## Conclusion

COVID-19 has now demonstrated community transmission in the US. While most cases will be mild (studies show about 80-85% of cases are mild, and many infected people don’t show symptoms at all), we will likely see a strain on the healthcare system, implementation of measures to slow down spread (like closing schools and cancelling big public events), and similar inconveniences. This is not some end-of-the-world pandemic, but now is the time to plan and prepare like you would for a hurricane, earthquake, or similar event. It's always good to check your emergency kit and plans!

This may lead to temporary closures of schools, large gatherings and events, and things of that nature when certain areas are seeing high levels of cases. We will all likely be inconvenienced by these measures at one point or another. Please be mindful of your higher-risk family.

A lot of this seems like simple common sense - and it is! - but it really is effective when everyone is taking these measures into account. When we currently lack a vaccine or specific treatments, social distancing and good hygiene measures are some of the most effective steps we can take.


Thank you for reading.
